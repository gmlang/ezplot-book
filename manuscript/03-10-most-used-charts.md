# 10 Most Used Charts

In the previous chapter, we learned how to use the function `plt_dist()`. It conveniently draws 3 of the 10 most used statistical charts at once in one figure: histogram, density plot, and boxplot. The other 7 are interval plot, scatter plot, bar plot, area plot, line (or timeseries) plot, slope plot, and heatmap. In this chapter, I'll show you how to use ezplot to make each of the 10 most used charts, including many nuances and variations. By the end of this chapter, you'll master the skills yourself. Because these are the most used charts, these skills will improve your productivity dramatically, especially for doing descriptive and exploratory analyses, writing reports and making presentations. 

Let's get started.
