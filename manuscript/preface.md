# Preface

This book will teach you how to do data analysis and machine learning in R. It does that by showing you the entire process through a case study step by step. You will learn

* how to clean data 
* how to do descriptive and exploratory analysis 
* how to create nice looking statistical charts
* how to build and interpret logistic regression (or logit) models
* how to do automatic model selection (for logit models) using the best subsets method
* how to run K-fold Cross Validation
* how to backtest a logit model using different performance measures: accuracy, sensitivity, false positive rate, specificity, precision, and the F-measure
* how to draw the ROC curve and calculate the AUC

You will get most out of this book by typing and running the code given in the book. Do NOT just copy and paste. Type the code. This will help you become a better programmer. So let's get started!
