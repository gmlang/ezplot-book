### Horizontal Bar Chart & Lollipop Plot

Previously, we mastered two ezplot functions, `mk_barplot_freq()` and 
`mk_barplot_resp()`. We can use them to easily make regular, dodged and stacked 
bar charts. There're two other ezplot functions, namely, 
`mk_barploth_freq()` and `mk_barploth_resp()` that can be used to create 
horizontal versions of the same bar charts. Let's make the horizontal versions
of the same bar charts we made in the last two 

```{r, barploth_freq_mpaa_cnt_p1, fig.cap="Frequency of MPAA"} 
library(ezplot)
plt = mk_barploth_freq(films)
plt("mpaa", yorder = "descend", label_decimals = 2)
```
