## Web Display

The plots created so far are too small for web display. If you are making an 
analytic web app, you may want bigger font size and everything. Luckily, the 
function `web_display()` comes to rescue. Often, all you have to 
do is to feed in the plot object, and it'll return a plot object that looks 
just right when shown in a web browser. Below is an example.

```{r, web_display, fig.cap="demo web display"}
library(ezplot)
library(dplyr)
plt = mk_scatterplot(films)
p = plt("votes", "boxoffice", alpha = 0.2, jitter = T) %>% 
        add_labs(xlab="number of votes", 
                 ylab="boxoffice (in USD)", 
                 title = "Boxoffice vs. Votes (1913-2014)",
                 caption = "Source: IMDB")
p = scale_axis(p, "y", scale = "log10") # use log10 scale on y-axis
p = scale_axis(p, "x", scale = "log") # use log scale on x-axis
p = add_lm_line(p, eq_tb_ypos = 0.95, eq_tb_xpos = 0.5) 
web_display(p)
```
