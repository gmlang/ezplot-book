# 10 Most Used Charts

I wrote ezplot to improve efficiency. Looking back to all the client projects I've done in the past 6 years, there're 10 charts I used frequently.

* histogram & density plot
* boxplot
* qqplot
* barplot
* horizontal barplot & lollipop plot
* likert plot (a.k.a, horizontal diverging barplot)
* scatterplot
* lineplot
* heatmap
* dumbbell plot

In this chapter, I'll show you how to make these charts with ezplot. I'll show you the nuances and variations. You'll watch your productivity soar, and by the end of the book, you'll be able to create these charts yourself with minimal effort.

Let's get started.
